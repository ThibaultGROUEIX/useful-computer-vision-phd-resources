# **useful-computer-vision-phd-resources**

This repo is to share my tribulation in installing different software and setting up a good workflow for my research in Deep Learning. Hopefully it can win some time to many people, and help my memory in the future.

It is inspired by [Yana Hasson's initiative](https://github.com/hassony2/useful-computer-vision-phd-resources) but mostly intended for me. Check out Yana's repo for great advices on how to conduct your research.

Note. A lot of this stuff is **outdated** now (2019).
