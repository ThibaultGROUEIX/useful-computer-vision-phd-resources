# Tips

* Use a template to start writing with pre-defined macros for each authors and subpages for each section
* Use Macro for everything that may change (name of method...)
* Use good names in the bibtex to make citing easy. For example use dataset names for datasets, method names for papers...
* https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/


At the end
* Check that each table/figures is referenced in the text
* Each method in the SOTA table is discussed in related work section
