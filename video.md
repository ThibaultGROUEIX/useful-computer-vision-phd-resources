## make a cool research video

* Software : For now, with my limited skills, I use either Rush or Imovie. Both are easy to handle. Rush does not have the "share" with someone else option. "imovie' is not maintained anymore.
* I use [Adobe Podcast Enhancer](https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance)  . On a tip from Jiaqi Su
* I use [bensoud](https://www.bensound.com/) for background music. On a tip from Richard Zhang
* I need a good video stabilization tool for mobile device hand-held capture but I don't have one.

Premier Pro is probably the next step, but it's more involved.
